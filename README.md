# .butter Replay Format

The .butter format is originally based on the work on [.milk by Exhibit](https://github.com/Exhibitmark/chode/tree/master/.milk%20Replay).
The goals of this format are as follows: 
 - Smallest possible file size
 - Minimal data loss
   - Some precision is lost through lower bit length numbers
   - Precision in timing should not be compromised
 - Data complete
   - All parts of the API response should be included


## Keyframes
In general, data for each frame in this format is only stored as a diff of the previous frame, however, a full reset happens every N frames. This allows decompression of partial replays and streaming, as well as prevents precision errors from building up over time. Keyframe intervals can be customized depending on the recording rate and use case, but keyframes cannot be spaced more than 1 minute of real time apart due to the timestamp encoding. If there is more than 1 minute between keyframes, a keyframe should automatically be inserted.
The start of a keyframe is denoted by the `0xFEFC` header instead of the normal `0xFEFE` header.


## Frames
Each frame represents the data retrieved from a single call to the game's API. Any numerical value in a frame is only stored as the difference from the previous frame, except for keyframes.

### File structure

### Frame Size
Below are estimated sizes for each frame. To get approximate full uncompressed file size, multiply the number by the number of frames. Average frame sizes are around 380 bytes experimentally.

- right_shoulder_pressed
- left_shoulder_pressed2
- right_shoulder_pressed2


### Disc
It would possible to eliminate the velocity component and only make use of frame diffs and timing to calculate velocity, but velocity 

| Bytes | Value |
| ----- | ---------|
| 2 | x position |
| 2 | y position |
| 2 | z position |
| 4 | [Orientation](#orientation)
| 2 | x velocity |
| 2 | y velocity |
| 2 | z velocity |

### VR Player
VR player is a simple [pose](#pose) value - 10 bytes.

### Pose
This is used for any position and rotation value

| Bytes | Value |
| ----- | ---------|
| 2 | x position |
| 2 | y position |
| 2 | z position |
| 4 | [Orientation](#orientation)


### Orientation
Orientations are usually presented in the API as 3 sets of XYZ direction vectors, but this can be encoded in 4 bytes with minimal precision loss by using [smallest three](https://gafferongames.com/post/snapshot_compression/) compression.
The orientation is converted to a Quaternion, then the component with the smallest absolute value is replaced by its index (in 2 bits). The other three values are recorded using 10 bits each.

| ??*N | N Frames |

### File Header

| Bytes | Data |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1  | MILK version |
| 2  | Keyframe interval, ushort |
| 2-20 | `client_name` ASCII string |
| 1  | null byte |
| 16 | `sessionid` Session ids are made of 5 hexadecimal words, containing 8-4-4-4-12 digits each, so 32 hexadecimal digits makes 16 bytes |
| 4  | `sessionip` IPv4 addresses can be stored as 4 bytes |
| 1  | Total number of players in this file. Since players can join or leave, this can be more than 15.
| (2-20)*n | ASCII array of player names separated by null bytes, where n=number of players in the match at any time. |
| 8*n | Player `userid`s |
| 1*n | Player `number`s |
| 1*n | Player `level`s |
| 1   | `total_round_count` |
| .5  | `blue_round_score`   << 0 |

| 1   | [Map Byte](#map-byte) (described below) |

#### Map Byte
Below is the bit flags structure for the Map Byte

| Bit number | Field name |
| ---------- | -----------|
| 0       | Public or Private, Public = 0, Private = 1 |
| 1-3     | Map name, see coding table below  |
| 4-7     | Currently Unused Bits |

#### Map name coding
| Index | Map Name |
| ----- | ---------|
| 0     | uncoded |
| 1     | mpl_lobby_b2  |
| 2     | mpl_arena_a |
| 3     | mpl_combat_fission |
| 4     | mpl_combat_combustion |

## Keyframes
In general, data for each frame in this format is only stored as a diff of the previous frame, however, a full reset happens every N frames. This allows decompression of partial replays and streaming, as well as prevents precision errors from building up over time.
The start of a keyframe is denoted by the `0xFEFE` header instead of the normal `0xFEFC` header. 


## Frames
Each frame represents the data retrieved from a single call to the game's API. Any numerical value in a frame is only stored as the difference from the previous frame, except for keyframes.

### Inputs
2-byte half-precision floats for each of:
- left_shoulder_pressed
- right_shoulder_pressed
- left_shoulder_pressed2
- right_shoulder_pressed2


### Disc
It would possible to eliminate the velocity component and only make use of frame diffs and timing to calculate velocity, but velocity 

| Bytes | Value |
| ----- | ---------|
| 2 | x position |
| 2 | y position |
| 2 | z position |
| 7 | [Orientation](#orientation)
| 2 | x velocity |
| 2 | y velocity |
| 2 | z velocity |

### VR Player
VR player is a simple [pose](#pose) value - 13 bytes.

### Pose
This is used for any position and rotation value

| Bytes | Value |
| ----- | ---------|
| 2 | x position |
| 2 | y position |
| 2 | z position |
| 7 | [Orientation](#orientation)

### Orientation
Orientations are usually presented in the API as 3 sets of XYZ direction vectors, but this can be encoded in 7 bytes with minimal precision loss by using [smallest three](https://gafferongames.com/post/snapshot_compression/) compression.
The orientation is converted to a Quaternion, then the component with the smallest absolute value is replaced by its index (in a byte). The other three values are recorded using 2 bytes each.
